First, make sure you've downloaded 
and installed the randomlib library
    http://randomlib.sourceforge.net/

and the Eigen headers,
    http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/

Optional plotting requires gnuplot
    http://www.gnuplot.info/

Assuming that randomlib and Eigen have 
been installed in /usr/local, running 
the examples is as simple as
    make all

Note that all of the examples can take
a few hours to run -- reduce the number
of the SoftAbs samples to speed things up.
